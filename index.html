        <h2>About me</h2>
        <article>
          I am <span class="lime-400">Mahmoud 3abdel3atte shalaby</span>. My address is <span class="cyan-400">Elbehera - Kom hamada - elza3phrany</span>.
          I am <span class="teal-400">15</span> years old. once, when i was in my school that was before about 3 years in 6 primay of me. My computer subject teacher was teaching us about making a website not much deep but she told us <span class="text-orange-400">HTML</span> is an acronym of <span class="text-orange-400">Hyper Text MarkUp Language</span>.
          That time i was super exited and i have tried to save it. But I failed in that time. And have gone to my teacher and said to her <span class="green-400">"What is the acronym of HTML"</span>.
          She has told me. And again i was trying to save it.
          I have <span class="emerald-400">succeeded</span>.
          And since that time i save it.
          After back home, I have searched in google about HTML. I was exciting up for that.
          Another day, I have found my neighbor's son he called <span class="red-400">Ahmed</span>.
          Then, i asked him about HTML. He was a programmer and that was the first time i know that.
          He told me about searching in youtube about anyone can teach me that.
          I have found a good channel called <span class="indigo-400">Elzero Web School</span>.
          I have started to learn HTML that osama elzero has uploaded it to youtube at 2016,
          i have forgot what was date of that day.
          After finishing HTML course,
          i have gone to <span class="text-red-400">Ahmed</span> super fast to know what's next.
          He told me <span class="text-sky-400">CSS</span>.
          And i finished CSS fast, then i tried to make some websites with that expertise.
          Again, I searched for next. He said to me HTML5 then CSS3.
          In that time, i was busy in my lessons and school so i couldn't continue learning that 2 courses.
          <span class="red-400">Ahmed</span> was saying to me day to day to learning that and i told him that reason every-time.
          After i had taken more rest from school and lessons i learned that courses.
          Then i have made the first mistake in my programming road and switch to learn game developing with unity.
          Then i have learned python and i now pro in it then after finished another programming languages.
          i asked more people about my next study road in real life.
          All of them told me continue in one field and<br><span class="violet-400">i have chosen full-stack web developer</span>.
